# PathFindingVisualizer
### Description:

A 2D path-finding visualizer using different algorithms in pygame.

### Packages:
- Pygame

### Algorithms: 
- Path Finding:
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - A* algorithm
- Maze Generation: Random

### Recommendations:
- L/R key for path-finding algorithms, U/D key for maze-generation algorithms
- More maze-generation algorithms: 
  - [ ] Recursive backtracking
  - [ ] Hunt and Kill algorithm
  - [ ] Eller's algorithm, Side Winder
  - [ ] Prim's Algorithm
  - [ ] Kruskal's algorithm
- More path-finding algorithms
- Add timer to time each algorithms
